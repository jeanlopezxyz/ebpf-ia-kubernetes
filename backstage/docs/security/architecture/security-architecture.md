# Security Architecture

## Overview
The eBPF + AI Security Platform implements a multi-layered security approach combining kernel-level monitoring with AI-driven threat detection.

## Components

### eBPF Monitor Layer
- **Kernel-level visibility** into network traffic and system calls
- **Real-time data collection** without performance overhead
- **Cilium CNI integration** for network policy enforcement

### AI Detection Layer  
- **Machine Learning models** for anomaly detection
- **Real-time threat classification** using supervised learning
- **Redis caching** for model inference optimization

### GitOps Security
- **ArgoCD-managed** security policies and configurations
- **Tekton CI/CD** with security scanning pipelines
- **Immutable infrastructure** with declarative security controls

## Security Controls

### Network Security
- eBPF-based network monitoring
- Cilium network policies  
- Ingress security with pfSense HAProxy

### Application Security
- Container image scanning
- Runtime security monitoring
- API authentication and authorization

### Infrastructure Security
- Kubernetes RBAC
- Service account token management
- TLS encryption for all communications
